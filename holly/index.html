        <h2>habitat</h2>
        Unicorns live high in the sky in the clouds on rainbows!<br/>
        They love the rainbows because they are so bouncy and fluffy
        they also love to dance on rainbows.<br/>
        Unicorns love to dance and be happy all the time,they are more happy when dancing on rainbows but less on clouds.
        <h2>food</h2>
        Unicorns eat sweets and cotten candy they also love to drink hot chocolate with marshmellows.<br/>
        Unicorns also come down to earth where they pretend to be horses and eat lots of carrots,apples and hay.<br/>
        They dont like apple juice or lemonaid so if you see one dont give it either of those things.<br/>
        The type of food they hate are vegtables its least favourite vegtables are peppers!
        <h2>activity</h2>
        They love to run around and jump over rainbow hurdles they also they love to punch the air with their back legs.<br/>
        They love and i mean love trying to jump over the moon.<br/>
        They hate to hop on one foot because they always fall and hurt themselves.<br/>
