title: "Creating iOS Shortcuts"
---

After complaining that there wasn't any decent documentation on Shortcuts I finally found the right combination of words to search for and found this page: <https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios>. Don't miss the "Table of Contents" link on this page. (I think I might have found this page before and dismissed it as not very helpful.)

A few other tips for creating shortcuts are:
* Use the triangle "Play" button in the bottom right of the shortcut edit screen to run the shortcut while working on it. Running the shortcut this way will show you more information than running it normally.
* The "View Content Graph" action can help to show you what's going on.
* When viewing the list of actions there are information icons on the right. Clicking these will show you some details about the action.
* If you want user input for a shortcut executed through Siri you can use the "Dictate Text" action.
