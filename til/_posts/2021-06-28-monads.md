title: "Monads"

Monads have a bit of a mystique about them, and there are a lot of confusing articles written about them. Today I found [this page](http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2958) (through [ycombinator's](https://news.ycombinator.com) [best news RSS feed](http://hnbest.heroku.com/rss)) which seems to do a good job of demystifying monads. It uses Haskell for examples, but I've never used Haskell before and the article still made sense to me.
