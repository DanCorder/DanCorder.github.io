title: "Jekyll Without Plugins"
---

I've been porting my blog over to this fairly vanilla Jekyll site hosted on Github and just found [Jekyll Codex](https://jekyllcodex.org/). It's a site that has loads of useful functionality implemented [without the need for Jekyll plugins](https://jekyllcodex.org/without-plugins/). I'll at least be using the Atom feed for inspiration.
