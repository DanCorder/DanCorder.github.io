On the off chance that someone is actually reading this, be warned that this blog is mainly going to be for things I find interesting and want some record of. If you find them interesting too then so much the better, if not then please feel free to move along, there are plenty of more interesting blogs out there. In fact this first post can contain the ones I regularly read (there, now it has a purpose).
