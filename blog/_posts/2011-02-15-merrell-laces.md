title: "Merell, what were you thinking?"
---

I've recently bought a new pair of [Merrell Chameleon Evo](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003726V24?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwdancorderc-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B003726V24) shoes, as all my previous pairs of Merrell shoes have been comfortable, and the Gore-Tex ones nicely waterproof.

These new ones seem to be similarly good, except that I have to wonder what on earth they were thinking when they chose the laces. The laces on these shoes are thin and smooth and won't stay done up for more than 10 minutes at a time. Were I actually hiking in these shoes I would very quickly get fed up or have to tie them in some kind of knot!
