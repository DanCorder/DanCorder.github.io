title: "Tyre Update"
---

I've been using Schwalbe Marathon Pluses for a few months now (switching from the original Kojaks), so I thought it was time for an update.

Since moving house there isn't anywhere near as much broken glass around on my commute, so it may not be a an entirely fair comparison, but nonetheless I've been puncture free since switching tyres.

The Marathon Pluses do seem to have very slightly more rolling resistance than the Kojaks. I'm not sure if that is due to the make-up of the tyre or just that they can't be inflated to as high a pressure as the Kojaks.

However, given that I cycle to get to work and back, and to get some exercise, the slight increase in pedalling effort is more than made up for by the extra reliability.
