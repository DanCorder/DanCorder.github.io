 A while ago I looked for a site that could plot out a cycle friendly route for me for my commute to work but failed to find one. I have now found [CycleStreets.net](http://www.cyclestreets.net/) and whilst I haven't actually tried the route they suggest yet I am very impressed with the (free) route planner they have on the site. Well worth a look if you want to plan a route through unfamiliar territory.
