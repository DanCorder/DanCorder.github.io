[A few months ago](/blog/2011/05/07/not-so-superior) I wrote about how my pedals had detached themselves a couple of times. I thought it was only fair to post an update to say that since then they have behaved perfectly. I also haven't removed them deliberately in that time which may or may not be related.

However, having now started my new commute, I've come to the conclusion that I would have been better off just getting some rather simpler and cheaper non-detachable pedals and using a pedal spanner if I ever had to remove them.
